Hi There! 
_______________
🎓 I’m Sandi Rahman, a tech enthusiast and Back End Developer in the making, with a special love for PHP (Laravel) and IoT projects. I’m currently exploring the world of programming through school projects, internships, and personal experiments, and I plan to keep sharpening my skills beyond the classroom.

👨‍💻 I enjoy building, breaking, and fixing things—whether that’s coding a game in Unity, making a smart IoT prototype with ESP8266, or designing sleek app interfaces in Figma and Flutter. I’ve worked on both solo and team-based projects, where I’ve learned the importance of not just technical skills but also collaboration and creativity.

🎸 Outside of tech, I love challenging myself with new experiences. My hobbies range from gaming, streaming Minecraft, and exploring puzzle games to organizing events at school, like art performances and OSIS activities.

📚 I’m passionate about personal growth and leadership. Being active in OSIS has taught me how to balance responsibility, teamwork, and creativity, while also staying committed to learning.

✈️ I’m also fascinated by traveling and exploring new places—it’s like debugging life in real-time, full of surprises and stories.
